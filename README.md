\
## Overview\
\
This project outlines the development and implementation of an advanced image processing system using MATLAB, designed to detect and classify colors and geometric shapes (specifically circles) within images. The system integrates several image processing techniques, including image loading, pre-processing, shape detection, geometric correction, and color classification, to achieve an accuracy rate of over 80%. This project demonstrates potential applications in automated quality control, object recognition, and pattern analysis.\
\
## Features\
\
- **Image Pre-Processing:** Converts images to LAB color space and applies noise reduction techniques to enhance detection accuracy.\
- **Circle Detection:** Implements morphological operations and region properties to precisely detect circular objects within the image.\
- **Geometric Correction:** Uses geometric transformations to correct image distortions based on the detected shapes.\
- **Color Classification:** Extracts and classifies colors within detected shapes using LAB color space analysis.\
\
## Use Cases\
\
- **Automated Quality Control:** Identify defects in manufacturing processes by detecting and classifying shapes and colors.\
- **Object Recognition:** Detect specific shapes and colors in various environments, useful for robotics and computer vision applications.\
- **Pattern Analysis:** Analyze visual patterns in images for research and development purposes.\
\
## Getting Started\
\
### Prerequisites\
\
- MATLAB with the Image Processing Toolbox installed.\
- Basic understanding of MATLAB and image processing concepts.\
\
\
## Introduction\
\
The main purpose of the project is to easily extract features from an image, such as colors. In this project, there is a pipeline where the first step involves calling a method which then calls many other functions: one for loading the image, another for detecting circles, a third for correcting distortions in the image, and finally, one for extracting colors. Image preprocessing in MATLAB is crucial for enhancing image quality, reducing noise, and extracting meaningful features, which ultimately improves the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent image processing tasks.\
\
## Methodology\
\
### Image Loading and Pre-processing\
\
Images are loaded using the `loadImage` function, which converts them to LAB color space for better processing. Initial preprocessing steps involve denoising the image using a mean filter to reduce noise.\
\
### Circle Detection\
\
The `findCircles` function employs morphological operations and region properties to detect circular objects in the image. This is crucial for correcting image orientation by providing coordinates for geometric transformation.\
\
### Image Correction\
\
Image orientation correction is achieved by comparing detected circle coordinates with a standard set, then applying a geometric transformation (`fitgeotrans`) to the image based on these coordinates.\
\
### Colour Detection\
\
In `findColours`, LAB components are extracted and squares are identified. Colors of the squares are determined based on LAB values, and a comparison is made with reference colors. Detected colors are then classified accordingly.\
\
### Integration and Automation\
\
The individual components are integrated into a single pipeline in the `colourMatrix` function. Images are processed automatically by sequentially calling functions for loading, circle detection, image correction, and color detection.\
\
## Results and Discussion\
\
### Performance Analysis\
\
Performance analysis of this project shows a commendable success rate of more than 80%, demonstrating its robustness across a variety of images. Effective circular detection highlights its efficiency, a key aspect of image processing tasks. Overall, the project's ability to consistently deliver accurate results highlights its reliability and effectiveness in achieving its objectives.\
\
### Discussion of Real Photographs\
\
When applying the algorithms developed in MATLAB to real "Photos.zip" photos, challenges arise due to lighting, image quality, perspective distortions, complex backgrounds, and color variations. These factors can affect the accuracy of algorithms based on coherence conditions or precise spatial relationships. To overcome these challenges, adaptations such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and reliability improvements may be necessary to ensure that the algorithms perform well on a variety of real photos.\
\
### Error Handling\
\
The system in MATLAB code implements error handling in several ways. For example, in the `colourMatrix` function, it checks the correctness of the file path before loading the image. Similarly, the `computeSuccessRate` function ensures that inputs are properly formatted and handles any errors using string manipulation and comparison functions inside the loop. Additionally, the code uses try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected errors that may occur during execution, ensuring that the program does not terminate abruptly and providing informative error messages for troubleshooting.\

## Limitations and Challenges\
\
A number of limitations and challenges were encountered during testing:\
\
- **Fixed Parameters:** The system relies on fixed parameters and assumptions that may not generalize well to different real images. For example, algorithms may struggle to accurately identify circles or colors in photos with complex backgrounds or variations in lighting.\
- **Complex Backgrounds:** The algorithms can face difficulties in accurately detecting shapes and colors in photos with complex backgrounds or significant color variations.\
- **Noise Handling:** Although noise reduction techniques were implemented, their effectiveness decreases with low-quality or highly distorted images, leading to suboptimal results. Further refinement of these techniques is required to improve the system's robustness.\
\
## Improvements and Future Work\
\
To enhance the system's performance and adaptability, several improvements and future developments are proposed:\
\
- **Real-Time Processing:** Incorporating real-time image processing capabilities would enable the system to operate in dynamic environments, making it more versatile for applications such as robotics and surveillance.\
- **Enhanced Robustness:** Refining the algorithms and tuning parameters could further improve detection accuracy, especially in scenarios involving complex backgrounds or varying lighting conditions.\
- **Integration with Sensor Data:** Expanding the system to integrate with sensor data could enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, such as environmental monitoring and automated quality control. Dynamic adaptation techniques could also be employed to make the system more responsive to changes in its operating environment.\
\
## Conclusion\
\
In conclusion, the project successfully developed a MATLAB-based image processing system that achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 80% in color and shape detection. Despite the challenges encountered, the system demonstrated its effectiveness in various test cases. Future enhancements, such as real-time processing and integration with sensor data, could further extend the system's applicability across multiple domains, including object detection and environmental monitoring. The project underscores the importance of continuous improvement in algorithm development to address real-world challenges more effectively.\
